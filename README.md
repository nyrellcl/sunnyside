# About the project

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


# Built With

Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flex
Grid
JavaScript

# What I learned

This project is the first one where I used Javascript, even if it was just using only one function. This helped me
understand how JS is fitted into the HTML structure and how to declare it inside. 

The hamburger menu was also a new concept. I had to look up other coder's examples of how to make it and figure out
how to seamlessly implement some of their code into my code. Thankfully, I was able to tweak the code to my liking and was able
to produce my desired results. 

Overall this strengthed my understanding of layouts such as flex and grid. It also broadened my awareness of responsive web design and 
keeping in mind the accessibility mindset when developing landing pages accustomed to different devices


Things still need to be worked on

I'm having trouble displaying the menu drop down for mobile version, to have the pointy top design when the user clicks on the mobile nav-bar. 
I have a pretty good idea of where to start.
